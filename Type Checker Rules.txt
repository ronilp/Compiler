Type Checker Rules:
i. The type of an identifier is the type appearing while declaring the variable.
ii. The type of TK_NUM is integer.
iii. The type of TK_FLOAT is real.
iv. The type of an identifier of a record type expanded with a dot followed by the
field name is same as that of the field.
v. The type of a record type is a tuple (type of field1, type of field 2, type of
field3,.......and so on). Example : Consider the following type definition
record #marks
type real : maths;
type int: rollnum;
type real: physics;
type real: chemistry;
endrecord;
The type of the above record is (real, integer, real, real) (say T).
vi. The type of a simple expression (say E) of the form expression(say E1)
<operator> Expression(say E2)
a. is integer, if both expressions are of type integer and the operator is
arithmetic operator.
b. is real, if both the expressions are of type real and the operator is
arithmetic operator.
c. is boolean, if both expressions are of type integer and the operator is
relational operator.
d. is boolean, if both expressions are of type real and the operator is
relational.
e. is boolean, if both expressions are of type boolean and the operator is
logical.
f. is record type T if both E1 and E2 are of the same record type T.
The type of the expression is ERROR, if the above rules do not derive the
type of E appropriately.
The type of an identifier or an expression is computed by traversing the abstract
syntax tree
