Type Checker Rules:
i. The type of an identifier is the type appearing while declaring the variable.
ii. The type of TK_INTEGERLITERAL is integer.
iii. The type of TK_FLOATLITERAL is float.
iv. The type of TK_STRINGLITERAL is protein.
v. The type of an array is same for all the elements of the array.
vi. The type of a simple expression (say E) of the form expression(say E1) <operator> Expression(say E2)
	a. is integer, if both expressions are of type integer and the operator is arithmetic operator (+,-,*,/,%).
	b. is boolean, if both expressions are of type integer and the operator is relational operator (<,>,<=,>=,!=,=).
	e. is boolean, if both expressions are of type boolean and the operator is logical (AND, OR, NOT).
vii. The type of the expression is ERROR, if the above rules do not derive the type of E appropriately.
viii. The type of an identifier or an expression is computed by traversing the abstract syntax tree
